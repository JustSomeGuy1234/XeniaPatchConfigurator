## How to use:
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/JustSomeGuy1234/XeniaPatchConfigurator/releases/latest) zip file and extract it anywhere. Now simply run the application.

You must use Xenia Canary, as normal Xenia does not support patches. You must install the **patches** folder yourself as detailed in [this guide](https://github.com/xenia-canary/game-patches#installing).  

If you are not using a portable version of Xenia Canary, keep 'Portable' unticked. If you are, tick it and navigate to the **patches** folder within the Xenia folder.  
If you pasted the portable path in, press either the enter key or the Update Path button and the patch list should fill with each game's patch file.  
  
You can favourite games by double clicking them. This will send them to the top of the list for quick access.

## Requirements:
.Net Core 3.1
